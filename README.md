# Project Issues 

Restful Routing:
The biggest challenges I encountered during this project was being able to have the links navigate to a specific page and render specific requests. 

## Future Enhancements
For future modifications, I would like to turn this CRUD web application into an E-Commerce platform for skincare companies. This application would allow users to optimize their beauty care experience by having more control with what they would be receiving in their monthly subscription boxes.
